Software development processes are split - so are the tools and languages they use. Specifications (most often informal), designs (often UML), implementation (one or many of the usual suspect programming languages), test (non-formal or TTCN3 or alike).
Industry and processes demand traceability between working products in the various disciplines.
Tool chains specific to each discipline are a luxury - extra cost, extra learning, one not understanding what the other does and add to the complexity of industrial software development.
U - the unified specification, modeling, implementation and test language is an attempt to consolidate the process of software product creation and to replace various tool chains by a single, concise, minimal, powerful and expressive language to cover it all.
